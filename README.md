# Realtime Web Application

A web application that uses cool real-time web technologies like WebSocket and webhooks. These technologies will make your app interactive and allow users to get live updates without having to refresh the page constantly.

With WebSocket, you can establish a direct connection between the user's browser and the server. This means your app can send and receive information instantly, making it feel more responsive and interactive. Users can chat in real-time or see live updates without any delays.

Webhooks will help your app stay up-to-date by automatically receiving notifications from other systems or services. For example, if there's new content or important events happening elsewhere, your app can get that information in real-time and show it to users immediately.

To make your app accessible to everyone, you'll need to put it on a public server. This means people can access it from anywhere as long as they have an internet connection. There are different options for hosting, like cloud platforms or traditional web hosting services. You can choose the one that suits your needs best.
